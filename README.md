# Online Investigations at Newmark J School

This is the syllabus, details, and dynamic notes for an investigative journalism [course](https://www.journalism.cuny.edu/courses/online-investigations-2020-election/) at the Newmark Graduate School of Journalism in the Spring of 2020.

# Welcome!

Welcome to this special investigations class geared toward gaining real-world experience investigating online political influence ahead of the 2020 election. We'll be working with the Quartz investigations team, led by John Keefe, to:

- investigate efforts to mislead citizens or undermine civic participation
- analyze political advertising for trends and patterns in content and effect
- collaborate with the Quartz audience to help spot efforts to mislead or divide them
- augment classic investigative reporting techniques with audience engagement, machine learning, and crowdsourcing tools
- brainstorm, strategize, and plan story directions and lines of inquiry
- work directly on stories, research, visualizations, or web applications 

We will work as a team, and on sub-teams, with opportunities for individual focus in any of these areas. Together, all students will take part in contemporary tactics used by today’s leading news organizations. Student work Quartz publishes will be credited by name.

Our objective is to learn real skills around considering and conducting online investigations by conducting — and, we hope, publishing — an actual investigative report.

In this class, as we do at Quartz, we celebrate, encourage, and foster a spirit of generosity and the force of ideas.

# Weekly Meetings

## Location

We meet in Room 432 every Monday from 9:30 a.m. to 12:20 pm, including a break. That said, there are a few modifications due to holidays, so check out the dates below. We may also plan one or two classes off site.

## Structure

Generally the first half of each class will consist of a knowledge-building lesson and discussion, and often a review of the previous week's assignment.

After a break, we will work directly on our investigations — brainstorming, researching, writing, coordinating with teammates, analyzing data, coding, making charts, editing, and/or meeting with the instructor. This is *your* time to get things done and work with your teammates. Use it wisely!

## Participation

This is a team-based class, and your participation is key for all 15 classes. You'll note below that being absent really hurts your grade, and right away. That's intentional — I'm placing a premium on being present.

If you are absent for some reason, be sure to seek out and do the assignment for the week. You don't want to lose those points as well.

# Tools 

## Computers in Class

Bring them! You'll use your computer in almost every class.

Be here now. Please don't email, DM, tweet, chat or otherwise communicate with people outside the class during class. Your participation with other classmates is key. If you must take a call or a text for an urgent issue, please step out of the room.

## Slack

Let's strive for a no-email class. We'll communicate using Slack, like just about every newsroom in the United States. It will also allow us to coordinate with journalists at Quartz and elsewhere.

Our Slack is [onlineinvestigations.slack.com](https://onlineinvestigations.slack.com). 

[Use this link to sign up](https://join.slack.com/t/onlineinvestigations/signup), and then use your school email address to complete the process.

Please format your "display name" using your full name, a slash, and your role. Like: **John Keefe / Instructor** or **Lisa Simpson / Student**. This will be especially helpful when other journalists join us.

## Google Drive

We'll be using a shared Google Drive folder to keep track of important documents, the investigation plan, and who's doing what. The link to this folder is pinned in the `#general` Slack channel.

# Grading

## Assignments

Each class will include an assignment, announced in class and posted on this site the same day. Assignments are due by _5 p.m. on the Friday before the next class_. Note that these Fridays may occur during holidays, so save yourself some stress and get them in _before_ the holiday begins.

## Points

There are 100 points possible.

* **Attendance:** 45 points possible, 3 points for each class attended. 
* **Assignments:** 45 points possible, 3 points for each assignment successfully completed on time. Incomplete or low-effort submissions will receive fewer or zero points. Assignments turned in after they are due receive a maximum of 1 point.
* **Participation & Progress:** 10 points possible. This will be scored based on your active participation and contribution in class and in the investigation. Note that absences will naturally cut into your participation score.

## Scale

| Points | Grade |
| ------ | ----- |
| 97-100 |  A+ |
| 93-96 | A |
| 90-92 | A- |
| 87-89 | B+ |
| 83-86 | B |
| 80-82 | B- |
| 77-79 | C+ |
| 73-76 | C |
| 70-72 | C- |
| < 70 | F |

## Plagiarism

Plagiarism is the use of another’s ideas or words, video or recordings, or ideas without properly and clearly acknowledging the source of the information.

This is a journalism class; facts and honesty are our greatest asset. Presenting the work of others as your own is wrong and won't be tolerated. Doing so may result in a significant reduction of accumulated points and possible failure of the class.

When using code or ideas from other sources -- even free, open-sourced code -- be sure to abide by any applicable licenses and include references and links back to the code and licenses. The lack of a license does not mean it's free to use. If you have questions about this, have a conversation with the instructor.

If you are inspired by others, note it. It's just right.

When working on teams, as we will in this class, you may be asked to honestly note the specific and/or relative contributions of each teammate.

Please note that other forms of academic dishonesty include:

- Unauthorized collaboration.
- Fabrication of information, quotes, or sources.
- Impeding the work of others.

# Class Plans

Below is a rundown of what I expect we'll cover in our weeks together. Be very aware, though, that this is a live journalism class: we will be working on real investigations we hope to publish, and we won't know the shape of those investigations at the outset. That means our class plans may change to help you succeed in your investigation. Significant changes in class lessons, topics, or plans will be announced in class, posted in the `#general` Slack channel, and updated here at least a week ahed of time.

**Notes** for each lesson will be posted here before each class.

**Assignments** are due at 5 p.m. on the Friday prior to the next class.

# Class 1 • Jan 27

**Kickoff:** Hello! In the first class we'll get to know each other and discuss the logistics and outlines of the semester. We'll also explore the basics of investigative reporting and the mission of the investigations team at Quartz — which you are essentially joining starting today.

**Investigations:** What are we going to investigate? That planning begins today with discussion, research, and some brainstorming.

**Participation alert:** As you see ads and messages in your accounts, screenshot the political ones and post them in the `#spotted` channel. 

**What do platforms think you like?**

Let's find out ...

Instagram, from [thenextweb](https://thenextweb.com/basics/2019/08/30/instagram-ads-list-interests/): "There are two slightly different paths to finding the list depending if you’re on mobile or the desktop site. To get to the list on mobile, go to Settings, then Security. Go to Access Data, then scroll all the way down to the bottom, where you’ll see Ad Interests, and select “View All.” On desktop, go to Settings, then Privacy & Security. Select “View Account Data,” and you’ll find Ad Interests at the bottom right."

Twitter: [Click this link](https://twitter.com/settings/your_twitter_data/twitter_interests/interest) and log into Twitter (if you aren't already). 

Google: If you're logged in, you can [get to your ad data here](https://myaccount.google.com/data-and-personalization). Note that there is LOTS more in your Google account settings tracking what Google knows about you. [Read more from Gizmodo](https://gizmodo.com/everything-google-knows-about-you-and-how-to-delete-it-1834633034). 

Apple (iPhone): Follow [these steps from WikiHow](https://www.wikihow.com/View-Apple-Ad-Information-on-an-iPhone).

Facebook: 
- Settings > Your Facebook Information > Access your information > Ads and businesses > Ad interests > Your interests
- Settings > Your Facebook Information > Off-Facebook Activity

- Take notes on these questions:
  - What were you surprised they knew?
  - What did they get completely wrong?
  - What did they say about your politics?
  
**Organic Messaging**

- Discuss the results of that survey

**Investigations**

- What we mean when we say "investigative journalism."
- **Class criteria** for our pursuits:
  - Does it fit the Quartz investigations mission: "We will investigate and expose efforts to influence, engage, confuse, and divide the US electorate ahead of the 2020 presidential election. We’ll take a close look at the companies, systems, governments, and other actors involved in those efforts -- and call them out when appropriate."
  - Would uncovering this be a civic good?
  - Are there victims?
  - Are we punching up?
  - Are we shedding light on something hidden, intentionally or otherwise?
  - Is there a remedy we can identify?
  - Can we involve the audience in the investigation?
  - Has someone else done this recently and in a way we couldn't do better?
  
- What it means to run an open investigation
- Having a social-media / tips / data / story / tips / etc plan

Due by 5 pm on the Friday prior to the next class.

# Class 2 • Feb 3

**Anatomy of a Facebook Investigation** You'll learn about a powerful tool we have at our disposal — The Facebook Political Ad Collector — from one of its creators, Quartz's Jeremy B. Merrill. He'll walk you through how it works and how you can use it.

Jeremy and Quartz's Hanna Kozlowska will then talk about how the ad collector led to a huge investigation into a gold- and silver-selling scheme that cheats conservative older people out of their retirement savings.

**Investigations** We'll review and discuss the stories you found and use those as a jumping-off point to explore and, we hope, zero in on avenues of exploration. 

We will also define our initial teams.

## Assignment

Each team crafts TWO story pitches, each consisting of:

- A description of the story, including your base thesis, assuming it works out as you imagine (1 paragraph)
- What you already know, or are pretty sure about (1 paragraph)
- What you'd need to find out. (1 paragraph)
- The headline. Assuming everything goes as you think it might.
- Whether or not it fits into each item of our investigations checklist, and how it does or does not. (X sentences)

Write each pitch as a separate google doc in our shared class folder and post the links to each document in your team slack. An example doc is in the class folder. 

Due by 5 pm this Friday — so be sure to meet again with your team this week to complete it. 

# Class 3 • Feb 10

**Working securely:** Let's talk about security. We'll get into how you can start practicing better personal security and about how to act responsibly and ethically with the data you get from others.

**Investigations:** You will get feedback and possibly a green light for one of your pitches.

Green-lighted teams will craft a **plan** to pursue your story and begin following leads, conducting research, collecting data, and testing your thesis.

They will also agree on a shared **system** for tracking what needs to be done, and who is doing what. Plan system must be set up to be understandable and visible to me and other journalists. I should be able to scan it to see your progress, where you are at, what you need to do next, etc. Use what works best -- for all, or for the chief organizer!

**Reminder:** No class next week. Assignment is due on the Friday before the next class. 

## Assignment
